# Repository for final project

In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.

- Created an Emotion Detection application using the functions from embeddable AI libraries
- Extracted relevant information from the output received from the function
- Tested and packaged the application created using the Emotion Detection function
- Completed web deployment of your application using Flask
- Incorporated error handling in your application to account for invalid input to your application
- Written codes that are in perfect compliance with PEP8 guidelines, getting 10/10 score in static code analysis
